### Create a fish

A population is a collection of fish. Therefore to create a population, we first create a fish. This fish will be used a prototype to construct the population.

Here, we create a fish and set some parameters:

```{r}
params_file = "../params/cod_params.ini"
```

Let us set parameters that allow us to reproduce the Dankel et al XXXX model.

```{r }
fish = new(Fish, params_file)
fish$par$Bhalf = 3.65e8

fish$par$growth_model_name = "Dankel22"
fish$par$maturation_model_name = "Dankel22"
fish$par$mortality_model_name = "Dankel22"
fish$par$recruitment_model_name = "BevertonHoltDirect"

fish$init(1.93e3, 5.61)
fish$par$print()
fish$get_state()
```

### Create a population

The constructor for the population requires a Fish object as an argument. This fish object will be used as a prototype to construct all fish in the population. You can create a fish population as follows:

```{r}
pop = new(Population, fish)  
```

### Setting population parameters

Population parameters can be set in the same way as fish parameters, using the `par` object in the population

Two parameters are important:

+ `n` - Superfish size. Since the population can have billions of fish, we do not simulate each individual fish. Rather, each "Fish" represents a group of `n` actual fish. This collection is called "Superfish". Reducing this parameter will necessitate simulating more agents in the model, which will reduce noise but also take more computational time. 
+ `Bhalf` - This is a parameter that controls density dependent recruitment. 


```{r}
pop$par$n = 2e6  # Each superfish contains so many fish
```

We can also set the management parameters for a population:

+ Harvest proportion - the proportion of fish that are allowed to be harvested every year
+ Minimum size limit - the size below which fish cannot be harvested

```{r}
pop$set_harvestProp(0)   # Harvest 
pop$set_minSizeLimit(45) # Only fish above 45 cm length can be harvested
```

### Initialising a population

By default, a population contains no fish. We must initialize the population with specified number of superfish.

```{r}
pop$init(1000, 1.93e3, 5.61)  # initialize the population with 1000 agents (superfish)
```

We can also peek at the state of the population. The state of the population is simply a dataframe consisting of the state of each superfish in the population.

```{r}
d = pop$get_state()
head(d)
```

### Simulating an unfished population

We can simulate a population by continuously `update`ing it. Each update performs 1 year of simulation, implementing the processes of maturation, growth, mortality, and reproduction for each fish in the population.

For example, let is simulate a population for 200 years.

```{r fig.height=9}
pop$verbose = T
nsteps = 200             # Let's simulate for 200 years
nfish = numeric(nsteps)  # Let's keep track of the number of superfish
nfish[1]=1000            # Since we initialized the population with 1000 superfish
cnames = pop$colnames
dat = data.frame(matrix(ncol=length(cnames), nrow=0))
colnames(dat) = cnames
for (i in 1:nsteps){
  v = pop$update(5.61)       # Update all fish over 1 year 
  dat[i,] = v    # some book-keeping
  nfish[i] = pop$nfish()
}

d = pop$get_state()
dist = table(d$age, d$length)

par(mfrow = c(3,1), mar=c(5,5,1,1), oma=c(1,1,1,1), cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5)
plot(nfish~seq(1,nsteps,1), ylab="No. of superfish", xlab="Year")
image(x=as.numeric(rownames(dist)), y = as.numeric(colnames(dist)), z=log(1+3*log(dist)), col=scales::viridis_pal()(100), xlab="Age", ylab="Length")

res = simulate(0, 45, F)
matplot(cbind(dat$ssb/1e9, res$summaries$SSB[1:200]/1e9), ylab="SSB (MT)", xlab="Year", col=c("cyan", "black"), lty=1, type=c("p","l"), pch=1)

```


### Bioenergetic model

Now, let's simulate the bioenergetic model and compare the results with the model of Dankel et al.

```{r fig.height=9}
fish = new(Fish, params_file)
fish$par$s0 = 0.059

pop = new(Population, fish)  
pop$par$n = 1e6  # Each superfish contains so many fish
pop$init(1000, 1.93e3, 5.61)  # initialize the population with 1000 agents (superfish)

pop$verbose = T
nsteps = 200             # Let's simulate for 200 years
nfish = numeric(nsteps)  # Let's keep track of the number of superfish
nfish[1]=1000            # Since we initialized the population with 1000 superfish
cnames = pop$colnames
dat = data.frame(matrix(ncol=length(cnames), nrow=0))
colnames(dat) = cnames
for (i in 1:nsteps){
  v = pop$update(5.61)       # Update all fish over 1 year 
  dat[i,] = v    # some book-keeping
  nfish[i] = pop$nfish()
}

d = pop$get_state()
dist = table(d$age, d$length)

par(mfrow = c(3,1), mar=c(5,5,1,1), oma=c(1,1,1,1), cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5)
plot(nfish~seq(1,nsteps,1), ylab="No. of superfish", xlab="Year")
image(x=as.numeric(rownames(dist)), y = as.numeric(colnames(dist)), z=log(1+3*log(dist)), col=scales::viridis_pal()(100), xlab="Age", ylab="Length")

res = simulate(0, 45, F)
matplot(cbind(dat$ssb/1e9, res$summaries$SSB[1:200]/1e9), ylab="SSB (MT)", xlab="Year", col=c("cyan", "black"), lty=1, type=c("p","l"), pch=1)

```

<!-- ### Quickly simulating an unfished population to equilibrium -->

<!-- It is possible to manually simulate a non-fished population to equilibrium as demonstrated in the previous tutorial. But there's an easier way: to quickly simulate an unfished population, we can use the function `noFishingEquilibriate()`. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # Create a population -->
<!-- pop_K = new(Population, fish) -->
<!-- pop_K$set_superFishSize(20e6) -->

<!-- # Equilibriate under no-fishing conditions -->
<!-- pop_K$verbose = T -->
<!-- state_equil = pop_K$noFishingEquilibriate(1.93e3, 5.61) -->

<!-- d = pop_K$get_state() -->
<!-- dist = table(d$age, d$length) -->

<!-- image(x=as.numeric(rownames(dist)), y = as.numeric(colnames(dist)), z=log(1+3*log(dist)), col=scales::viridis_pal()(100), xlab="Age", ylab="Length") -->


<!-- ``` -->
